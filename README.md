Within each directory, each file is listed along with when it was last changed and a brief description of the change.

If you click on a file and then click on "History" while in that file's documentation, you can see the full history of that file and even view previous versions.

For uploading new files (or updating existing ones), just drag and drop the file into the relevant directory. When prompted at the bottom of the page, write a brief description of the file/changes made.

Please create README.md documents in each folder explaining the files uploaded (or add to an existing README.md in that folder).
