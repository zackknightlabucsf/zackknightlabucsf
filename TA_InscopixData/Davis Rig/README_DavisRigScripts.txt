These scripts were all done with TA's Davis Rig protocols (Sucrose taste curves, and taste panel). 

Because each of these protocols have specific orders of solutions, you might need to change the names of the solutions, 
or the number of solutions altogether.

I am still including these scripts in case they are useful, but please consult me if you would like to actually use them.
