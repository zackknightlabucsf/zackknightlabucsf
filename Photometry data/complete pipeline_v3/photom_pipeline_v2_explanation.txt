Quick rundown on how to use this pipeline
By: James Grove

1. First make photometry data useable!
-Run writing_mat_files_fast_v3

2. Generate a metadata file!
-Run make_metadata_file
-Input information into the generated excel file
"exp" means the experiment name (must contain "licks" if lickometer was used)
"Z" means the id of the mouse in the top chamber
"K" means the id of the mouse in the bottom chamber
"Notes" is for anything you might want to add
"baseline_length" is the duration of time (in seconds) used for baseline
"manip_time" is the timepoint (in seconds) when a manipulation (eg. Injection) was made
"after_manip" is the duration of time (in seconds) the experiment lasts after manipulation was made
"downsample_to" is the rate (in Hz) you want to downsample to (e.g. 4Hz)

Optional parameters (can be left blank; used for lickometer analysis):
"access_length" is the duration of time (in seconds) that access was given for
"access_time" is the timepoint (in seconds) when access was given

Additional note for lickometer analysis:
"manip_time" should still be given (it is whenever baseline ended; usually same as "access_time")
"after_manip" should still be given (it is how long the experiment continued past manip_time)

NB. In case any of the times differ from mouse in Z vs. K, make separate lines for each

NB. Baseline is assumed to end at manip_time

NB. The following must be the same across mice in a given experiment:
baseline_length, after_manip, downsample_to

3. Compile the data!
-Run compile_data

4. Make some graphs!
-Run licks_analysis OR ip_analysis
